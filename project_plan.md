# John Holt PLC — Corporate Website

## 1. Project Description
A premium, modern corporate website for **John Holt PLC**, a long-established Nigerian business group. The site must communicate heritage, trust, technical credibility and innovation, and showcase business divisions (Power Generation/Generators, Fire Safety & Firefighting Solutions, Engineering/Technical Services and other divisions), while driving enquiries and quote requests.

Target users: corporate/institutional buyers, facility & procurement managers, industrial clients, and general business visitors researching John Holt PLC's services.

No real company facts (stats, leadership names, certifications, client logos, exact addresses) were supplied — these will be implemented as clearly structured, easily editable placeholder content so verified information can be swapped in later without restructuring the site.

## 2. Page Structure

- `/about` - About Us (history, mission, values, leadership, milestones)

## 4. Data Model Design
No database required — this is a content/marketing site. All content (services, projects, news, testimonials, FAQs) will live in typed mock data files under `src/mocks/`, ready to be swapped for a CMS/API later. Contact and newsletter forms use the built-in Form feature (no backend needed).

- Map: Google Maps embed iframe on Contact page

- Deliverable: Working Home page with hero, stats, divisions, projects teaser, why-us, testimonials, news teaser, CTA; functioning nav + footer

### Phase 2: About + Services (overview + detail pages)

Nav dropdown + hub "Learn more" links now resolve.

### Phase 3: Projects, News, Careers, Partners, FAQs

### Phase 5: Polish pass
- Goal: Cross-page QA
- Deliverable: Animation polish, accessibility pass, SEO metadata across all pages, responsive QA
- Progress: [x] Per-page SEO metadata system added — reusable `usePageMeta` hook sets document title, meta description, canonical URL and Open Graph/Twitter tags; applied to Home, About, Services (hub + all detail pages), Projects, News (hub + article detail), Careers, Partners, FAQs, Contact and all three legal pages. Detail pages pull title/description dynamically from service and article data.
- Progress: [x] Accessibility pass — added a skip-to-content link and a focusable `main` landmark at the app shell; gave the desktop Services mega-menu and the mobile Services toggle proper `aria-haspopup` / `aria-expanded` states; decorative chevron icons marked `aria-hidden`.
- Progress: [x] Animation audit — verified the shared `fade-up` scroll reveal is applied consistently across all 50+ sections, respects `prefers-reduced-motion` via the global motion override, and added an `IntersectionObserver` fallback so reveal content can never remain hidden. Phase 5 complete.
- Progress: [x] JSON-LD structured data added — a reusable `JsonLd` component plus a `src/lib/schema.ts` builder module emit schema that mirrors visible content: `Organization` (site-wide, from the app shell), `LocalBusiness` for each office in Lagos/Abuja/Port Harcourt including opening hours (Contact page), and `FAQPage` generated from every FAQ question/answer (FAQs page).
